		  <h1>About the club</h1>

		  <p>
Hamilton Junior Naturalist Club, (HJNC) or Junats for short, is for young people from the age of 10 to 18, who have enthusiasm for some aspect of natural history and the outdoors.
		  </p>


		<p>
		  Children, young adults and family groups have been meeting new friends and learning about the natural world around them with JUNATS since 1961. The club built and owns Te Kauri Lodge at Oparau, Kawhia, and is active in the restoration of Te Kauri Park Reserve.

If you are interested in the sciences, natural history, the outdoors and enjoy meeting other people with similar interests then this could be the Club you have been looking for!

Come along to one of our Friday night presentations to meet and chat with us about who we are and what we do.

		  <h1>Te Kauri Lodge Museum</h1>
		  <p>
		    Junats has one of the best little museums in NZ located right here at Te Kauri Lodge.
		  </p>
		  <p>
Our museum is brainchild of our very own historian/archaeologist/cave explorer/naturalist Chris Templer, and was built by Chris along with a dedicated team of Junat volunteers.
