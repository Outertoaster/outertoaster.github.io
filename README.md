# WIP HJNC site
heavily modified from my dusty old github pages site, it will eventually be moved to its own server once thats ready

A minimal website for the Hamilton Junior Naturalist Club, to act as a bridge for a fancier and more complex website.
Said website doesent exist yet.

The old one lacks any responsiveness and has outdated info
